							<ul class="ingredients">
								<li>
								Knead the dough with 1/2 tablespoon oil and sufficient amount of water. The dough should be a little tougher than your average pizza dough. Keep the dough aside for 1/2 an hour
								</li>
								<li>
							To your boiled and mashed potatoes, add all the dry spices, the finely chopped onions and salt. Mash it so that there are no lumps. Ensure that your potato mash is not watery
								</li>
								<li>
								On your kitchen board, sprinkle a little dry flour. Make balls of the dough you had kneaded. Roll one ball at a time into a thick small circle and the circle in your left hand, and place the potato mash in the centre. Then, fold the edges in wards like you do in a dumpling, ensuring that no filling is exposed. 
								</li>
								<li>
									Roll this dumpling so that it becomes a proper round again
								</li>
                                <li>
Sprinkle some dry flour on the ball and the board. Place the ball, down, and with your rolling pin, gently press to make a plus sign. This will help ensure that the stuffing is spread evenly all through. 
								</li>
                                <li>
									Very gently roll the ball in to a flat not to thin circle. Keep in mind that the stuffing should not come out. 
								</li>
                                <li>
									Heat a skillet to medium temperature. Grease it with butter, then cook both the sides of the paratha, by flipping it over, so that the sides brown properly. 
								</li>
                                <li>
									Your paratha is ready to eat. Serve it with pickle (Indian), yogurt, or just a dab of butter! Excellent to beat the cold. 
								</li>
                                      </ul>
